# OptiCharge â€“ Solar & Grid-Aware EV Charging Controller

OptiCharge is a Python script to intelligently control EV charging via a supported wallbox charger and the Hyundai BlueLink API.  
It adjusts charging current in real-time based on **solar surplus**, **battery SOC**, and **time-of-day grid charging windows**.

## Features

- ðŸ”‹ **Solar surplus charging** â€“ match EVSE current to excess PV generation.
- ðŸŒ™ **Off-peak grid charging** â€“ automatically top-up during configured low-rate hours.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Target SOC control** â€“ syncs Hyundai AC target SOC to your desired limits.
- ðŸ’¤ **Vehicle re-auth** â€“ automatic BlueLink reauthentication and retry on failure.
- âš¡ **Dynamic amps** â€“ real-time adjustment to soak up surplus, with ramping & anti-flap.
- ðŸ›‘ **Anti-thrash** â€“ cooldown timers for start/stop and current changes.
- ðŸ“Š **Debug output** â€“ prints PV, house load, battery SOC, EV SOC, headroom, and state each loop.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Hyundai BlueLink credentials (USA API supported)
- Supported wallbox charger (with API access)
- Optional: Solar/battery data source (e.g., Tesla Powerwall API)
- `config.yaml` with your settings

### Python packages
Install from `requirements.txt` (if included), or manually:

```bash
pip install requests click pyyaml

python opticharge.py -c config.yaml start
